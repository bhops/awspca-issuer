# AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority

AWS Certificate Manager Private CA is a Certificate Authority managed by AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/private-certificate-authority/). It allows creation of root and intermediate CA's that can issue certificates for entities blessed by the CA.

# cert-manager

cert-manager manages certificates in Kubernetes environment (among others) and keeps track of renewal requirements (https://cert-manager.io/). It supports various in-built issuers that issue the certificates to be managed by cert-manager.

# AWS Private CA Issuer

This project plugs into cert-manager as an external issuer that talks to AWS Certificate Manager Private CA to get certificates issued for your Kubernetes environment.

# Setup

Install cert-manager first (https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/), version 0.16.1 or later.

Clone this repo and perform following steps to install controller:

```
# make build
# make docker
# make deploy
```

Create secret that holds AWS credentials:

```
# cat secret.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: aws-credentials
  namespace: awspca-issuer-system
data:
  accesskey: <base64 encoding of AWS access key>
  secretkey: <base64 encoding of AWS secret key>
  region: <base64 encoding of AWS region key>
  arn: <base64 encoding of AWS Private CA ARN>
```

```  
# kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
```

Create resource AWSPCAIssuer for our controller:

```
# cat issuer.yaml

apiVersion: certmanager.awspca/v1alpha2
kind: AWSPCAIssuer
metadata:
  name: awspca-issuer
  namespace: awspca-issuer-system
spec:
  provisioner:
    name: aws-credentials
    accesskeyRef:
      key: accesskey
    secretkeyRef:
      key: secretkey
    regionRef:
      key: region
    arnRef:
      key: arn
```

Apply this configuration:

```
# kubectl apply -f issuer.yaml

# kubectl describe AWSPCAIssuer -n awspca-issuer-system

Name:         awspca-issuer
Namespace:    awspca-issuer-system

Now create certificate:

```
# cat certificate.yaml

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: backend-awspca
  namespace: awspca-issuer-system
spec:
  # The secret name to store the signed certificate

  ipAddresses:

  # Duration of the certificate

  # Renew 1 hour before the certificate expiration
  renewBefore: 1h
  isCA: false
  # The reference to the step issuer
  issuerRef:

    kind: AWSPCAIssuer
    name: awspca-issuer
```

```
# kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml

Check certificate and private key are present in secrets:
