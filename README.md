# AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority

AWS Certificate Manager Private CA is a Certificate Authority managed by AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/private-certificate-authority/). It allows creation of root and intermediate CA's that can issue certificates for entities blessed by the CA.

# cert-manager

cert-manager manages certificates in Kubernetes environment (among others) and keeps track of renewal requirements (https://cert-manager.io/). It supports various in-built issuers that issue the certificates to be managed by cert-manager.

# AWS Private CA Issuer

This project plugs into cert-manager as an external issuer that talks to AWS Certificate Manager Private CA to get certificates issued for your Kubernetes environment.

# Setup

Install cert-manager first (https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/), version 0.16.1 or later.

Clone this repo and perform following steps to install controller:

```
# make build
# make docker
# make deploy
```

Create resource AWSPCAIssuer for the above controller:

```
# cat issuer.yaml

apiVersion: certmanager.awspca/v1alpha2
kind: AWSPCAIssuer
metadata:
  name: awspca-issuer
  namespace: awspca-issuer-system
spec:
  provisioner:
    accesskey: <aws access key>
    secretkey: <aws seecret key>
    region: <region>
    arn: <ARN of AWS Private CA>
```

```
# kubectl apply -f issuer.yaml

# kubectl describe AWSPCAIssuer -n awspca-issuer-system

```

Now create certificate:

```
# cat certificate.yaml

apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: backend-awspca
  namespace: awspca-issuer-system
spec:
  # The secret name to store the signed certificate

    - foo.com
  # IP Address SAN
  ipAddresses:

  # Duration of the certificate
  duration: 24h
  # Renew 8 hours before the certificate expiration
  renewBefore: 1h
  isCA: false
  # The reference to the step issuer
  issuerRef:
    group: certmanager.awspca
    kind: AWSPCAIssuer
    name: awspca-issuer
```

```
# kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml
# kubectl describe Certificate backend-awspca -n awspca-issuer-system

Check certificate and private key are present in secrets:
